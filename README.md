# Doctor Case Label Testing

GYANT SDET Challenge

## Background

Some time ago, we were asked to create a web application to allow doctors to evaluate medical cases by reading an Electronic Health Record ("EHR") of a patient encounter, and labeling it with a "Condition" (i.e. a diagnosis). All the information in the original request for this project can be found in the [Context](https://github.com/GYANTINC/gyant-sdet-qa-code-challenge/wiki/Context) page.

In order to deliver this project, the codebase available in this repository was implemented. You can read more about how to execute it in the [Installation](https://github.com/GYANTINC/gyant-sdet-qa-code-challenge/wiki/Installation) page. 

As you can observe, there is no automated test or validation of any kind in this repository.

# Assignment

Define and implement the tests of the types and levels you consider useful/necessary to help us validate the correctness of this piece of software. The choice of the testing techniques and instruments to employ is also yours (you should naturally take the tech stack of the existing codebase into account).

All the written/implemented tests and validations should be portable (i.e. automatically executable on a local machine, a server, a CI/CD platform, etc.).

If you wish to, you can suggest or even implement small refactors/tweaks to make the source code more testable. The same is valid for all the bugs you may find.

# QA

The tests are inside the folder automation. To run read the: [Automation Readme](https://github.com/diogocleite/gyant_qa_code_challenge/blob/main/automation/README.md)
